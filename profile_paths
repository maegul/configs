# so anaconda python precedes brew python
# this may have problems, which I didnt foresee ... 
# ... there are other binaries installed in anaconda that collide with /usr/bin, /usr/local/bin etc
# better way to make anaconda python? aliases? pyenv?
# /Users/errollloyd/anaconda/bin
# conda has automatic init shell script (see bottom of bash_profile), problem still exists however

# personal binaries
/Users/errollloyd/bin

# brew binaries
/usr/local/bin

# Personal thingys more associated with my bash profile and trivial custom things
/Users/errollloyd/.dotfiles

# NEURON ... bless its heart
/Applications/NEURON-7.4/nrn/x86_64/bin

# for some old binaries that are probably not there any more :(
